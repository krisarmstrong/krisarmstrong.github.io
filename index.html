            <h2>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h2>
            <p>As a network and security expert with over 20 years of hands-on experience, I blend technical depth with a customer-centered approach to drive secure, scalable solutions. </p>
            <p>At NetAlly, I serve as a technical resource for Territory Sales Reps (TSRs) and Channel Account Managers (CAMs). I guide customers in pre-sales support, deliver in-depth post-sales training, and empower our partners to strategically position and sell our solutions. Through seamless collaboration with sales teams and R&D, I ensure that the “voice of the customer” shapes our product roadmap, driving year-over-year growth and continuous innovation.</p>
            <p>Results and customer impact are at the heart of my approach:</p>
            <p> •   Enhanced customer satisfaction scores by 20% through targeted, hands-on training and dedicated support.</p>
            <p> •   Improved efficiency in NETSCOUT’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC), reducing resolution time by 30%. </p>
            <p> •   Trained 500+ customers, increasing product adoption and supporting strategic growth.<br>
            One of my most rewarding experiences involved helping a key customer solve a complex security challenge by designing a tailored training program that empowered their team to use our tools effectively. This approach resolved their issue and strengthened their loyalty to our solutions.</p>
