        <p>
            With over 20 years of experience in networking and cybersecurity, I am a results-driven professional known
            for designing, implementing, and managing secure, scalable network solutions that drive business success. My
            career spans roles such as Senior Systems Engineer, Sales Engineer, Systems Architect, and Security
            Architect, where I’ve consistently delivered impactful, innovative solutions to complex technical
            challenges.
        </p>
        <p>I specialize in pre-sales engineering, partnering with enterprise sales teams to craft tailored technical
            demonstrations and proof-of-concept (POC) solutions that secure multimillion-dollar deals and long-term
            client loyalty. My expertise in cybersecurity leadership, incident response, and threat mitigation has
            enabled organizations to enhance their security posture and achieve compliance with frameworks like ISO
            27001 and NIST CSF.
        </p>
        <p> Passionate about mentoring teams and empowering clients through training, I leverage Python and Bash
            scripting to automate workflows, optimize operations, and deliver measurable results, including exceeding
            annual sales quotas by 120% and improving customer satisfaction scores by 20%.
        </p>
        <p>I thrive in dynamic environments where collaboration, innovation, and customer-centric solutions are at the
            forefront, and I’m excited about driving meaningful impact in future endeavors.
